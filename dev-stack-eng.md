# Technologies

## Database

- **MongoDB**
  > This choice is justified by flexibility and less strictness towards data structures.
  The application involves many possibilities related to editing and adding new documents to the parent document.
  To reduce intellectual and physical costs, I believe this will be the best choice.

## Backend

- **Node.js**
  > I have the most development experience in this language, so this choice is made superficially.
  The choice of an additional framework is still open. Each one needs to be examined separately to find the best option for the application that meets the most requirements.

#### Framework for NodeJS
- **Nest.js**
  > Based on my information, our choice is limited. It's either Express.js or Nest.js. Nest.js is more scalable, so the choice remains with it.
  It also provides under-the-hood structure for development and comes with tools for caching, validation, and authorization.

## Frontend

- **React.js**
  > The most popular framework for developing interfaces. Moreover, when developing a mobile application,
  there will be no need to write it from scratch.

- **React Native**
  > Motivated by the easy transfer of the main application to the mobile space.

## Authentication

- **JWT**
  > One of the most popular and simple solutions for ensuring privacy and data security.

## Caching

- **Redis**
  > The most popular solution for caching requests and reducing computational costs. Moreover,
  it would be good to learn it to enhance qualifications.

## Real-time Messaging

- **WebSocket**
  > One of the simplest and flexible solutions for implementing data exchange via a READABLE STREAM. I have a little experience with it,
  and developing this project will allow me to expand my knowledge of streams.

## Data Storage

- **[_~~Data removed~~_]**
  > Any service that provides the ability to quickly upload and retrieve files will be suitable. Preferably with low rental costs.
